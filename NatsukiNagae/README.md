## Research Project
## abstract
### background
A DNA sequence model named AlphaGenome has been released that enables prediction of gene regulation with extensive DNA context length and high-resolution analysis.
The objective of this study is to verify whether AlphaGenome is useful for analyzing the relationship between SNPs and gene expression.

### method
Based on target base information from the J-MICC study's SNP array, a dummy SNP dataset was prepared for the X chromosome. Simulation analysis of gene expression levels was performed using AlphaGenome.

### result and discussion
Number of simulations suitable for AlphaGenome analysis:
・Approximately 30 simulations yield high prediction accuracy (RMSE ≈ 0.01)
・Approximately 25 simulations result in a low risk of reproducing individual SNPs (p < 0.01)
The usefulness of AlphaGenome for large-scale prediction of gene expression from SNP data was supported.
