# FY2025 Laboratory Research

🇺🇸 English | [🇯🇵 日本語](README_JPN.md)  
This repository contains the publicly shareable research outputs (e.g., Jupyter Notebooks, analysis scripts, workflow programs) that were created by third-year students assigned to the Department of Medical Artificial Intelligence and Data Science during the FY2025 Laboratory Research, a course at the Faculty of Medicine, Tokushima University. These materials represent educational activities and are **not finalized publications**.  


## Overview
This repository serves as an educational resource and a record of our lab’s research training activities.  


## Disclaimer
All materials are prepared for educational purposes and exclude any data or project details that cannot be publicly shared, such as human cohort data requiring consent or unpublished animal study data. Contents are limited to publicly shareable components and may be simplified. Because these outputs were created by students during training, they may contain errors or unintended behaviors and are not intended for clinical or production use.
